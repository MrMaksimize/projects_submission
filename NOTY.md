## Info
Noty Messages is a library that brings in customization available in the Noty
jQuery plugin (http://needim.github.com/noty/) into Drupal and allows the library's rendering of messages overtake Drupal's default message theming style. The goal of the module is to be extremely flexible and allow overriding of only certain Drupal message types if that's what the developer wishes.

I originally wrote this module in order to pass the vetting process on Drupal.org to become an authorized contributor and I now maintain it as a project.
