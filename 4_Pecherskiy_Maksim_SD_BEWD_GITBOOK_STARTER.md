## Info
Oftentimes, it's not the technical complexity of a project that's important to me, but rather the challenge in making something easier for someone to use.  When my team was writing our [Mid-Year Report - http://chronicles.coquicoders.org](http://chronicles.coquicoders.org) for Code For America, it took a while to figure out how to properly structure our Gitbook repository.  I also got a few questions about it from some other people in the organization, so I decided to make a quick starter repository.  

Sometimes the hardest thing is to explain to someone completely non-technical how to use something -- a challenge I solved with this project.
