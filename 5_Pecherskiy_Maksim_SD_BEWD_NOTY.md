## Info
Noty Messages is a library that brings in customization available in the Noty
jQuery plugin (http://needim.github.com/noty/) into Drupal, and allows the library's rendering of messages to overtake Drupal's default message theming style. The goal of the module is to be extremely flexible and allow overriding of only certain Drupal message type -- if that's what the developer wishes.

I originally wrote this module in order to pass the vetting process to become an authorized contributor on Drupal.org, and I now maintain it as a project.
